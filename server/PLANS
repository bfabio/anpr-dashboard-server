PSEUDO CODE
===========

1) Register a few URLs
2) Register a 404 handler
3) 404 handler uses a dict of urls to decide what to do:
  a) Send a redirect to some programmed page.
  b) Display a Markdown file.
  c) 404 page - has a login option.
     - if enough privileges, Display interface to add a link.
     - if enough privileges, may display a page that has not been published yet.


GIT PAGES
=========
1) All git repositories go in one folder
2) Periodically, all folders are scanned for README.md files, or INDEX.md
3) Based on path of file, an URL is computed.
4) Any directory between the top level directory and the file can contain a .goospel.yaml file

_separately_

1) A tool monitors the git repositories.
2) Checks them out in a specific folder.
3) Notifies the web interface of the update.


INTERFACE
=========
1) On top right corner, display:
   * [if-authorized] + button, to add a link or repository.
   * [if-authorized] share button, to share a page with others, display current people with access.
                     share button, standard social network share.
   * login / logout
   * some sort of admin page, showing state of repositories?
     state of links? some statistics?

SHARING WALKTHROUGH
===================

0) if document is public, just send an email.
1) if document is private...
  a) send email with token.
  b) when page is reached, invite user to login or register (if not already).
     once registered / logged in, let user see the page.
     note that a token allows a single user to see the page.
       So once a user is logged in, the page is added to its privileges,
       and token is consumed.


OAUTH WALKTHROUGH
=================
- is user authenticated? He should have a cookie if he is.
